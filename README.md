## Google Vision API workshop
Welcome to the workshop about image recognition using Google's all new shiny :sparkles:Vision:sparkles:  API! 

### Getting started

1. Set the `API_KEY` value in  `index.html` (we will email the key to you before the workshop)
2. Open `index.html` in your favourite browser and start playing with the code!


### About the sample code

The sample code we provide will give you a kickstart to start sending requests to Vision API. You can [read more](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/concepts#types_of_vision_api_requests) about the different types of API calls that Vision supports.

### Workshop suggestions

Now it's time to play with the code! If you don't know what to do, maybe try to build one of these ideas:

* Use face detection and translate the response into a emoji. If you upload a happy face it should show :smiley:, etc.
* Use face detection and try to draw the face using a graphics library (e.g [RaphaÃ«lJS](http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/))
